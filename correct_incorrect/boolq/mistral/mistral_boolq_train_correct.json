These values can take the form of a reduced paid-up policy, extended term policy, or cash surrender value. The cash surrender value is the amount of money that the insurance company will pay to the policyholder if they choose to cancel the policy. This value is based on the policy's cash value, which is the amount of money that has accumulated in the policy over time due to the policyholder's premium payments and the investment returns earned by the insurance company on those premium payments.
